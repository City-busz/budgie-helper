Version 3.10.0
==============
- Initial version.
- GNOME Flashback session. Includes sessions with Metacity and Compiz as
  window managers.
- GNOME Sound applet. This is same sound applet that used to be part of GNOME
  Control Center. Actually this is not applet, but application that provides
  icon for notification area / system tray.
- Desktop background. Application will simply draw background image to root
  window without any effects.
- End session dialog. Application will show logout, restart and shutdown dialogs
  when needed. (#710804)
- Idle monitor. Application will monitor user activity. This will fix invisible
  cursor bug.
- Updated translations:
  Andika Triwidada (id), Daniel Mustieles (es), Dmitry Shachnev (ru),
  Enrico Nicoletto (pt_BR), Marek Černocký (cs), Matej Urbančič (sl),
  Piotr Drąg (pl), Rafael Ferreira (pt_BR).

NOTE: This is first release and is intended to improve GNOME Flashback session.
Don't expect that this module will solve all problems! There is still a lot of
work to do to make this session in good state.
